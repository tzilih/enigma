This app lets you encrypt a message to be shared with others using a secret passphrase. Optionally, you can set an expiration date after which an encrypted message can no longer be decrypted. 

To run:
- Clone repository
- npm install 
- npm run build
- npm start
- go to localhost:4000/new and you will be automatically assigned your first passphrase, which can be changed.

Happy encoding!!
